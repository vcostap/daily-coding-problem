# daily-coding-problem

This repository was made to keep daily coding problem solutions. It's part of my studies to learn Ruby and improve logic.

Link to the website to subscribe and receive the problems: https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/

The structure will be:

Main folders -> year-month. Each folder will have many txt files with the task and ruby files that contain the solutions named by the day.
